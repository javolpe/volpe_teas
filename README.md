# Volpe_teas

This is a mock backend for a tea subscription service where customers can order various tea subscriptions.  The application is built with Ruby and Ruby on Rails.  The backend receives and returns request as an API using JSON format. All information is stored and persisted in a PostgreSQL database.


The API endpoints allow customers to create a subsription for themselves to receive a tea subscription, toggle their own subscription on or off, and see all of their subscriptions, both active and cancelled.
